## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{I am interested in looking at the change over time in abundance/density of breeding birds. Avian ecology is a fantastic way to get a bigger-picture idea of the general health of an ecosystem, as health of individual populations rely on so many factors within the ecosystem.

The dataset is rather robust and offers plenty of variables to incorporate into an analysis. I am not sure exactly what I am going to focus on yet, but I am quite interested in the relationship between temperature and observations, as birds are highly sensitive to temperature and are much less active when it is hot. As such, rising temperatures may make it harder to find and record sightings of these birds. This could lead to a sampling bias as global temperatures rise that would suggust bird populations are declining when in reality they are simply harder to detect.

This is the kind of work im interested in pursuing further both in a Master's and as a career. I have participated in many of these surveys here in Canada as a surveyor and so I am quite familiar with the general data, but I have never done any analysis on it. I'm quite excited that I am able to tailor a project so closely to my personal interests!}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The dataset was put together by the National Park Service, a branch of the U.S. Federal government. The data is intented to be used to track changes in avian population numbers and inform managment decisions within the parks. This particular dataset covers 2007-2017. The dataset has 30 columns that include variables such as date, time, weather, temperature, and species, among others. This data is recorded by humans, following a strict, standardized North American breeding bird survey protocol. This data should be conducive to a dashboard, The ability to isolate data by species and see their distribution on a map would be interesting. I have some GIS experience and I am hoping to be able to incorporate that in some way.
